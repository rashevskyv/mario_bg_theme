# Mario theme BG Modern

This is a custom theme for the Nintendo Switch, compatible with firmware version 15 and above. It can be used with the [SwitchThemeInjector](https://github.com/exelix11/SwitchThemeInjector)

The theme features a modern take on the classic Mario theme, with a nice and contrast background. The settings menu has also been rearranged, with the Parental Controls and Tech Support entries removed.

Two versions of the theme are available:

* Emunand version, which does not include icons for the eShop, NSO, and News.
* Semistock version, which include all icons.
